# The English TeX FAQ

## Origins and maintenance

This FAQ was started as a committee effort by the [UK TeX Users'
Group](http://uk.tug.org/). For many years it was maintained by Robin
Fairbairns. It is now a community-driven effort led by a core group of
volunteers.

## Scope

The FAQ aims to cover key topics across the TeX world. The widespread use of
LaTeX means that many questions are about this system, but the FAQ also covers
the core of TeX, plain TeX, ConTeXt. It also covers topics on allied tools and
ideas, for example BibTeX.
