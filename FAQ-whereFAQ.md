Bobby Bodenheimer's article, from which this FAQ was developed, used
to be posted (nominally monthly) to newsgroup `comp.text.tex`. The
(long obsolete) last posted copy of that article is kept on CTAN for
auld lang syne.

The sources of the present FAQ are available from CTAN.

This FAQ and others are regularly mentioned, on `comp.text.tex` and elsewhere,
in a "pointer FAQ" which is also saved at
[https://tug.org/tex-ptr-faq](https://tug.org/tex-ptr-faq).

A 2006 innovation from Scott Pakin is the "visual" LaTeX FAQ.
This is a document with (mostly rubbish) text formatted so as to
highlight things we discuss here, and providing Acrobat hyper-links to
the relevant answers in this FAQ on the Web.
The [https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/visualFAQ](visual FAQ) is provided
in PDF format, on CTAN; it works best using Adobe Acrobat Reader 7 (or later);
some features are missing with other readers, or with earlier versions
of Acrobat Reader.

The Wikibook about LaTeX [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/FAQ](offers a FAQ).

Another excellent information source, available in English, is the
[(La)TeX navigator](http://tex.loria.fr/).

Both the French-speaking TeX user group, GUTenberg, and the Czech/Slovak
user group CS-TUG have published translations of this FAQ in the past,
with extensions appropriate to their languages.

The French FAQ is currently hosted on an open wiki at
[https://faq.gutenberg.eu.org/](https://faq.gutenberg.eu.org/)
and is [https://www.gutenberg.eu.org/faq](actively updated).
Its contributors have gathered material from the French historical FAQ
from `fr.comp.text.tex` and from this FAQ. Feel free to contribute! 


Other non-English FAQs are available (off-CTAN):

- German: Posted regularly to `de.comp.tex`, and [https://www.ctan.org/pkg/faq-de](archived on CTAN);
  another version is maintained on a wiki:

- Italian: See [https://www.guitex.org/home/it/faq](https://www.guitex.org/home/it/faq);
- Spanish: A FAQ is [http://www.aq.upm.es/Departamentos/Fisica/agmartin/webpublico/latex/FAQ-CervanTeX/FAQ-CervanTeX.html](published by CervanTeX),
  the Spanish TeX user group.
