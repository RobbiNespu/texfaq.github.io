Peter Wilson's article [`memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memdesign) has a lengthy introductory
section on typographic considerations, which is a fine tutorial,
written by someone who is aware of the issues as they apply to
(La)TeX users.  ([`Memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Memdesign) now distributed separately from
the manual for his [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class, but was originally part of
that manual)
