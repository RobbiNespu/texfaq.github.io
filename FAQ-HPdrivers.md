The emTeX distribution (see [TeX systems](FAQ-TeXsystems.md))
contains a driver for the LaserJet, `dvihplj`.

Version 2.10 of the Beebe drivers supports the LaserJet. These drivers
will compile under Unix, VMS, and on the Atari ST and
DEC-20s.

For Unix systems, Karl Berry's `dviljk` uses the same
path-searching library as `web2c`.
