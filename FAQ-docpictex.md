PicTeX is a set of macros by Michael Wichura for drawing diagrams
and pictures. The macros have been freely available since the 1980s.
Since June 2020 the Manual is also available on CTAN.


There is also a summary of PicTeX commands available on
CTAN, which is a great aide-memoire for those who basically
know the package to start with.
