Peter Wilson's article [`memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memdesign) has a lengthy
introductory section on typographic considerations, which is a fine tutorial,
written by someone who is aware of the issues as they apply to (La)TeX users.
([`Memdesign`](https://ctan.org/pkg/Memdesign) now distributed separately from
the manual for his [`memoir`](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) class, but was originally
part of that manual)

Charles Hedrick's [_Guidelines for Typography in NBCS_](https://cgvr.cs.uni-bremen.de/links/typography.pdf)
(New Brunswick Computer Services): this short manual is intended to be a checklist
on how to present a document. The author's website
([archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160422065608/http://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/index.html))
is also worth checking: it provides versions of this document in fourteen different fonts,
for comparison purposes.


Would you like to experiment with a such basic concept than kerning,
you could try the website [kerntype website](https://type.method.ac/).
With on-screen practical examples, it will train your eye
with a diversity of typefaces.
